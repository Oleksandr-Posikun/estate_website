# Project "Real Estate Website"
Welcome to the repository of the "Real Estate Website" project! Here we are developing a web application that provides information about rental and sale offers for residential and commercial properties, as well as relevant news from the real estate world.

### About the Project
Our goal is to create a convenient and informative resource that helps users find suitable real estate offers in their region. The website will allow users to browse listings for buying and renting various types of properties, including residential and commercial properties.

We also plan to include a section for current news to keep our users updated on the latest events and trends in the real estate market. We strive to provide high-quality and reliable information to help users make informed decisions.

### Technologies
Our project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

* ___Frontend___ :
  > We use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. We also leverage popular frameworks and libraries such as React for efficient development and enhanced user experiences.

* ___Backend___ :
  > For the server-side development, we have chosen the Python programming language and the Django framework. Django provides powerful tools for building web applications, handling data, and ensures the security and efficiency of our project.

* ___Database___:
  >  In our project, we initially utilize SQLite as the database for storing information. However, as the project progresses and requires more scalability and robustness, we plan to transition to PostgreSQL.
